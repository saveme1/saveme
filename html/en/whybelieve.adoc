== Why believe in God?
image:andromeda.png[Andromeda Galaxy,float="left"] 
From the modern knowledge of astronomy we can see that God exitsts. Astronomers
have scientifically shown that the universe is 13.7 billion years old.  That
means the universe has a beginning. But everything that has a beginning did not
create itself, it must be made by another. That 'other' that has no beginning,
we call 'God'. It is very reasonable to believe in God.

TIP: It is much easier to believe in God, than to wrestle with all kinds of arguments. Nonetheless, it is not hard to see that God exists by looking at our universe.
