== Why be a Christian?
+++<img src="html/images/goodshepherd.png" align="left" alt="Jesus Good
Shepherd - St. Johns Ashfield" ></img>+++Many religions believe in God, but not
all are Christians; why then be a Christian if we believe in God?  If Jesus
proves that He is God, then it stands to reason that we should be a Christian.

If Jesus is God, then we should follow Him!! If we already believe in God (see
Why Believe?) and we know that Jesus is God, then we should follow Jesus! But
how do we know that Jesus is God?

WARNING: There is only one religion whose founder claims to be God:
'Christianity'. Buddha does not claim to be God, Confucius does not claim to be
God, Mohammed does not claim to be God. Only Jesus claims to be God.

So how do we know that 'Jesus is God'? First because He said it, second because
He proved it.

that Jesus said He is God: _"before Abraham was I AM" (John 8:58)_. Thomas the
Apostle explicitly calls Jesus God, and Jesus praises Thomas because he
believed: 
[quote, RSV Bible, John 20:28-29]
 _"Thomas answered him, My Lord and my God! Jesus said to him, Have you
believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet
believe."_

Jesus explicitly praises the Apostle Thomas because he now believed. What did
Thomas believe? That 'Jesus is God'. Faith believes in what is not seen, but
Thomas believed because he had seen the Resurrection. Thomas did not need proof
of the Resurrection, he could see it with his own eyes, but the Resurrection is
the proof that Jesus is God. For this reason Thomas said '"My Lord and my
God!"' 

Jesus performed many miracles, they are all proof that Jesus is God. Others did
miracles in the name of God, but Jesus made miracles in His own name:
[quote, RSV Bible, Mark 4:39]
'[Jesus] said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a
great calm.[...] And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, "Who
then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?"'

+++<img src="html/images/lazarusraised.png" align="left" alt="I
AM"></img>+++Jesus proved that He is God by His miracles. One of the greatest
was the raising of Lazarus from the dead, a miracle which Jesus did in His own
name.  Lazarus had been dead for four days, such time had passed that his body
smelled. It was already decomposing. Yet, Jesus said: _"Lazarus, come
out. The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with bandages"_ (John
11:43-44). 

Many eyewitnesses saw this miracles with their own eyes, and it is recorded it
in the bible. There is not even one document in early history that denies that
this happened. Even Jesus' enemies believed it, because they wanted to kill
Lazarus so that people would not follow Jesus any more.  Like this there are
many other miracles in the bible, I would encourage you to read it yourself. A
good place to start is the Gospel of St. Mark.

Jesus, by His miracles, proved that He is God. This is confirms that we should
be Christians.
