== Prayer 
Jesus, I am enslaved to sin; please deliver me. I trust in You. I give You my
eyes, my computers, my hands, my thoughts, my ears, my phones, but most of all
my heart. Please free me from this slavery, You are my sure hope. I will go to
confession quickly so that I can be freed from my sins and receive Your
forgiveness. You died for me, I know You can save me, because You are my God.
Please help me.
