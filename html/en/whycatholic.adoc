== Why be a Catholic?

only one Catholic church. If we believe in Christ we could join any Christian
denomination, why then be a Catholic? Why be part of the Catholic Church?

If we are a Christian, we believe that 'Jesus is God'. God doesn't make mistakes,
so if He tells us He has a Church, then that is the Church we should join. So
the question is, did God build a Church on earth?

To find the answer, we simply need to see if Jesus --who is God--, ever said
that He was going to build a Church. Today, with computers, it is easy to
search the bible. If you do a search, you find it in the Gospel of Mathew
chapter 16. God says _"And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my
church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it."_  (Matthew
16:18)

IMPORTANT: 'God' --'Jesus'-- is telling us not only that he built a Church, but
he also tells us how to find it: Peter. Wherever there is Peter, there is the
Church.  Now only the Catholic Church has a list of Popes, starting from St.
Peter himself until today. There is only one religion in the world today with a
lineage of Popes that go back to St. Peter himself. Therefore, it is easy to
see why we should be 'Catholic' if we are Christians.
