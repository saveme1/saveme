== About
`Save me` is software for Catholics, but we rejoice if it helps anyone!  It is
meant for people that have an addiction to indecent websites on the internet.
It includes prayers, and some other information, and it does as best as it can
to protect your computer so that you don't have easy access to those indecent
websites.

On the bottom of the Save me window you can see if it was able to protect your
computer. If protection is enabled , it will say something like "Your computer
is protected" in the bottom.

The real protection however is only 'Jesus'. Only in Him you will be freed from
your slavery to sin. If you follow Him, He can give you reasonable happiness in
this world, and perfect happiness in the world to come. But you must make a
decision to follow Him. 'There is no other way'.

Save me is free software and will always remain free.
