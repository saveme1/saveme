== About
`Save me` is software for Catholics, but we rejoice if it helps anyone!  It is
meant for people that have an addiction to indecent websites on the internet.
It includes prayers, and some other information, and it does as best as it can
to protect your computer so that you don't have easy access to those indecent
websites.

The real protection however is only 'Jesus'. For that reason save me
concentrates on prayers, making it easy for you to access prayers on your
computer.  Only Jesus will free you from slavery to sin. If you follow Him, He
can give you reasonable happiness in this world, and perfect happiness in the
world to come. But you must make a decision to follow Him. 'There is no other
way'.

Save me is free software and will always remain free.
